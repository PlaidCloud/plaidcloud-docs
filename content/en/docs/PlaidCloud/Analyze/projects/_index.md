Description: A Project is a place in PlaidCloud to manage a set of functions and data objects that serve a business purpose. For example, a Project could be BOM_Build, which is a set of workflows, tables, data imports, and so on that all work together to build the Bill of Materials. A Project is used exclusively in data management and does not include the display of data through a dashboard.
