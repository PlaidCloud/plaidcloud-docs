## Description


Create a copy of a data table.




{{< include "common-table-source-and-target.md" >}}



When performing the copy, Analyze will first check to see if the target data table already exists. If it does, no action will be performed unless the **Allow Overwriting Existing Table** checkbox is selected. If this is the case, the target table will be overwritten.
