## Description


Performs an update on the table using the specified filter conditions and value settings. The operation is performed directly on the designated table, so no additional tables are created. This may be an effective approach when concerns of data size are encountered.



## Table Selection


Select the **Source** table for updating from the dropdown list. This list includes all *Project* and *Workflow* data tables.







## Examples

In this example the Account will be set to 41000 when the Account is currently = 42000 in "Ledger Value to be allocated".
