Specify join conditions. Using the **Guess** button will find all matching columns from both **Table 1** as well as **Table 2**. To add additional columns manually, right click anywhere in the section and select either **Insert Row** or **Append Row**, to add a row prior to the currently selected row or to add a row at the end, respectively. Then, type the column names to match from **Table 1** to **Table 2**. To remove a field from the **Join Map**, simply right-click and select **Delete**.
