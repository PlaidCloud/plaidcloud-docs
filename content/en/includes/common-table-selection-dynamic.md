## Table Selection


There are two options for selecting the table or in the second option tables to:

The first option is to use the ***Specific Table*** dropdown to select the table.

The second is to use the ***Tables Matching Search*** option in which you specify the **Search Path** and **Search Text** to select the table or tables that match the search criteria. 
This option is very useful if you have a workflow that creates a series of commonly named tables that that have been saved appending the date.
