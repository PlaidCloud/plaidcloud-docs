## Our Solution Partner Program Goals

We want a strong and vibrant partner ecosystem that is sustainable for both us and our partners.  Ultimately, we want partners to be the trusted advisors to PlaidCloud
customers that need to solve problems for which PlaidCloud is a great fit.  Building great software is only valuable if customers find it and use it to create value for themselves.  Helping customers find, select, and implement software solutions is not easy work and we want to make sure, through revenue sharing, that the effort is valuable to our solution partners.

We also want to recognize the investments necessary to communicate and sell solutions that solve big problems for customers.  Those deals are often large and complex
so a partner will need to invest in training, certifications, and sustained marketing efforts.

Finally, as a hat tip to those boutique implementation firms, we know that when you are small and highly focused on implementations it is challenging to make sales while simultaneously implementing.
Therefore, we only require maintaining at least one certified PlaidCloud Analyst to remain an active partner.

We also want to acknowledge that no two deals look the same.  Please feel free to contact your Partner Advisor at any time if you would like to discuss tier qualifications in unusual circumstances.

## Revenue Sharing

To receive revenue share (commissions) you have earned when your registered prospects purchase PlaidCloud, you must complete the enrollment for payment. 

For more information, see the ‘Revenue Share and Payment’ section in the Partner Program Agreement

When one of your registered and accepted prospects buys PlaidCloud, you are eligible to receive revenue share for that deal based on the monthly recurring net revenue paid by the customer to PlaidCloud while they maintain an active subscription for product line(s). The revenue share depends on your partner tier:

| Partner Tier | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Year 6 Onward |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Diamond      | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | 20%           |
| Platinum     | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | 20%    | -             |
| Gold         | 20%    | 20%    | 15%    | 15%    | -      | -             |
| Silver       | 20%    | 15%    | 15%    | -      | -      | -             |
| Partner      | 15%    | 15%    | 15%    | -      | -      | -             |


Revenue share payments increase in value with higher level partner tiers.  Why do we have different revenue share amounts?  Because we know that building a professional sales organization is hard work and dedication to an in-depth solution understanding as well as potentially longer sales cycles for larger deals requires more shared value to the partner.

Qualification is renewed annually on a calendar year basis (January through December).  The currently effective partner tier dictates the revenue share percentage.  Thus, partners can increase revenue shares for prior year deals as progress is made in the tiers.  Qualifications exclude deals and revenue to partners and their affiliates.
Revenue share payments are paid out on a quarterly basis, and will be forfeited if you do not provide paperwork within 6 months of joining the program.

## Register Your Current and Prospective Clients

You can register current or prospective clients within your Partner Portal in order to be eligible for revenue share when you sell PlaidCloud to that client.

Client registration is intended for your current and prospective clients only. Partners should only register clients that they have established a demonstrable business relationship and who you are actively approaching and are engaging with in a pursuit of a sale. 
 
Each accepted registration will expire six months (180 days) from the date the prospect was registered. If you are actively pursuing a prospect and the registration is expired, then you may re-register the prospect manually for another ninety (90) days.

Partners can choose to use deal registration as another way to register clients. When a partner creates a shared deal through deal registration, the system automatically attempts to register the client for that deal to the partner. If the client is available, it will register the client to the partner. If the client is not available, the shared deal will still be created as a co-sold deal (if a PlaidCloud direct sales rep owns the domain) or as a best partner wins deal (if another partner owns the prospect).

Please note that rules around tier credit and commission eligibility do not change with deal registration and are still based on client ownership.

It is important to familiarize yourself with all PlaidCloud Solutions Partner Program Sales Rules (this includes detailed processes for how to pursue prospects that are not eligible for registration).
